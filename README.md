# FrameworkLens

FrameworkLens is a lightweight Streamlit survey app that scores readiness across three areas: NIST AI RMF, COSO ERM, and core GRC practices. It is designed for quick demos and discussions, not as a formal assessment tool.

Live demo: https://frameworklens.streamlit.app/

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
